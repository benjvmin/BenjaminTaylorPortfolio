# Benjamin Taylor Portfolio

 Holy cow! I finally did it! After long months of wearing different hats, I am finally at a point where I can say that my portfolio is ready for the world. I also made a blog! I've built it with some pretty amazing open source technology. You can find a comprehensive list of features, challenges, and miscellaneous writing about my experience below.

## Features

#### Vue.js + Vue Router
I embraced Vue.js as a step up from working with Vanilla Object Oriented programming, due to it's progressive nature I started with simple string templates and comfortably moved to single file components. I opted for starting with [Vue Cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) because constant focus on the black hole that can be build tooling equals lost time actually developing. I still did have to configure [scss imports](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/328), and it was enough to consider having my own fork of Vue.js with this ability for every project.

#### Styling without CSS Frameworks
Instead of opting to use a CSS framework I decided to use a mixture of modern web standards for layout, resonsive typography based on [The Elements of Typographic Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326),

#### Headless Content Management via Wordpress REST API
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
